        <p  style="font-size:10px;"> Katie Mead is a student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. She received her B.A. in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Virginia in 2020. She completed undergraduate research in the school of education on a teacher evaluation instrument called the CLASS (Classroom Assessment Scoring System). In this research she saw the fascinating ability of large amounts of data to tell a story about optimal conditions for learning. She also co-founded a student organization called the Resilience Project--a club that encourages students to reframe failure as feedback and break down the shame around experiencing setbacks in college. This club founding experience, along with the club's message, was an important message as she explored challenging STEM subjects at UVA. She completed the premedical curriculum at UVA, but decided to not pursue a degree in medicine. Katie was gradually drawn to the field of education through her research and volunteer experiences. After college, she taught high school chemistry for two years at Valor College Prep High School in Nashville, TN through Teach For America. This experience was not a typical introduction to teaching as it was the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. Teaching students through zoom drew Katie into alternative ways of guiding students to master the content. Whether this was through interactive Google Forms, virtual lab experiences, or online gamified learning, Katie had to be creative in her delivery of the content. What was missing in student connections, was present in lots of data. Katie built dashboards in Google Sheets that showed students exactly what assignments they needed to complete in order to be successful. She also built assignments that were differentiated to each students' level of ability, allowing them to smoothly move through the content towards mastery. Still, all of this data made her see how much work there was to be done in mitigating the impacts of virtual learning. This motivated her to learn more teaching techniques and analytical techniques that would help her best serve her students. She realized that there was no other choice than to pursue graduate work, and the technical side of the data analysis work she did was the deciding factor for pursuing a degree in data science and analytics. There are countless possibilities for bringing machine learning to best personalize learning for students. An example that sticks out to Katie is the ALEKS intervention, a virtual math program that uses a clustering algorithm to notice patterns in its large dataset of students. Through these clusters, it notes the most efficient progression and layering of skills to bring students back to grade level in math. I saw the ALEKS intervention used to assist many of my students, and I see much more potential for these kinds of technologies in schools. There is no better time to explore these avenues than now--where we are confronted with the realities of unfinished learning from covid and there is unprecedented access to technology in schools. Katie looks forward to all that she will continue to gain in the data science program.</p>

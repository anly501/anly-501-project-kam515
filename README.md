What can we learn from state takeovers of low-performing school districts?

K-12 education in the United States is the subject of renewed interest after the disruptions from the covid pandemic. Nearly all public schools in the United States were virtual for at least part of the 2020-2021 school year. Data is just beginning to emerge about the impacts of the pandemic on student learning. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a standardized test given to students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grade with no stakes attached, gives an early indication of the impacts. In two years, the average reading score for a 4th grader fell by five points which represents the largest drop since 1990 (Bloomberg). Math scores dropped seven points–the first decline in the history of the test (Bloomberg). These results show that the pandemic erased 20 years of student gains in reading and math (Bloomberg). There is no question that education worsened because of the pandemic, but the question that follows is…what now? How do we respond to this discouraging data?

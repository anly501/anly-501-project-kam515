            To better ascertain why migrant school districts are so clearly different from migrant districts, a decision tree algorithm is a helpful choice because decision trees display which variables drive the separation of the data. In the code below, it is clear that the default decision tree had many layers and was therefore non-interpretable. Re-setting the max depth of the decision tree to three was much more helpful in determining which variables were most important in the separation of the data. The clearest indicator of a migrant district was having a larger number of non-teaching support staff. Second was having a greater number of teachers and thirdly was general support staff. It was interesting to see how the raw number of students (enrollment) was not in the top three variables.

            Discussion:
          </h2>
          <p>
            In general, the decision tree supports the findings of the confusion matrix and other exploratory data analysis completed. The decision tree shows that the separation of the data is driven by the number of non-teaching support staff, teachers, and general support staff. The confusion matrix shows that the data is clearly separable and that the decision tree is a helpful tool in determining which variables are most important in the separation of the data. 
          </p>  
          <p>
            In the future, a random forest analysis could be helpful at being more confident in which variables are most important in the separation of the data. A random forest algorithm works by creating many decision trees and then averaging the results. This is helpful because it reduces the variance of the decision tree and therefore makes the results more reliable.

            The results of the support vector machine were very similar to the results of the Naive Bayes analysis. The support vector machine was able to classify the data points with a high degree of accuracy. The support vector machine was able to classify the data points 88-93% of the time depending on the kernel used. This method further supports that US school districts with migrant students have key differences from districts without migrant students. The hyperplane was able to classify the data points with a high degree of accuracy. This method can be used to verify other methods and can be used to classify new data points.

            Outside of this project, SVM can be used for other clustering scenarios, especially those with high dimensions.
          </p>
        <p>
            The clustering algorithms used for this dataset were helpful in that they showed different ways in which the data could be clustered. More exploration is needed to better understand the trends that lead to the separation. Knowing these trends could help illuminate the reasons why migrant students are concentrated in certain areas.

            Most of the resulting associations were predictable such as student and education. In general, the measure used in this study that proved most useful for the analysis was the exploratory word cloud. Although perhaps rudimentary and simple, seeing the most frequent words was most helpful for understanding the big picture of educational discourse. However, ARM has many other potential uses outside of this project worthy of exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of this project, ARM could be used to find associations between, for example, subgroups of students just like clustering. The advantage of ARM is the ability to visualize a network model and to be able to tweak the confidence and support to achieve the most useful results.
          </p>
        <p>
            The ARM algorithm was used to find the most common rules in the Wikipedia dataset. The rules were then visualized using the network visualization. Overall, the results did not add any major insights to the project, but the visualization was further confirmation of previous exploratory analysis. The visualization was also a good way to see the relationships between the variables in the dataset.

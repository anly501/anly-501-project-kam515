        <h1>EXPLORING DATA</h1>
        <p>
            Initial data exploration is an important step in the data science life cycle because initial visualizations and views of data can guide the direction for the rest of the project. Although initial exploration does not involve any statistical methods outside of basic descriptive statistics, it is still important to confirm intial hunches and guide the rest of the project. For the initial exploration, I chose to complete a word cloud on text data and create some statistical plots of the migrant dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
            As will hopefully become clear in the later tabs, data exploration is an iterative process. Before deploying each algorithm, exploratory plots would be constructed to determine the best settings for the parameters and, again, to confirm intial hunches about the data.

        <b>Figure 1: Word cloud of "K-12 education" news headlines in the US</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The above word cloud represents popular headlines in news organizations based in the United States. The keywords used were "K-12 education". Words that appear more frequently in the headlines are larger in size. The word cloud was created using the python package wordcloud. Additionally, a count vectorizer algorithm was used to create a word frequency table. The word frequency table is viewable on the GitHub code repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notably, the words "parent", "attach", and "shortage" stand out as unexpected to me as a reader. Still, this prominence stands out given larger recent discussions around the K-12 educational system and teacher shortages. It is still important to contextualize this word cloud in the fact that it was produced by data coming from the News API--a news aggregator. Thus, the word cloud is not representative of the entire population in the United States, but can serve as a good indicator for the larger discourse going on surrounding education.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, it was interesting to note the prominence of the words "edtech" and "partnership". These words would likely not have appeared in a world cloud just a few years ago. In other words, this word cloud is a good indicator of the current state of the K-12 educational system in the United States.

    <b>Figure 2: Side-by-side comparison of districts with and without migrant students</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the figure above, there is a closer view of key student-level data points between districts with and without migrant students. Districts without migrant students tended to have higher levels of students identified as special education. And, unsurprisingly, districts with migrant students tended to have higher numbers of English language learners.

    <b>Figure 3: Further comparison of districts with and without migrant students (values are per 1000 students in the district)</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Figure 3 offers an interesting comparison of districts that do and do not report migrant students attending. In general, districts with migrant services tend to have higher rates of students who are economically disadvantaged and English language learners. This is not surprising given the nature of migrant students. The US Federal Government also allocates extra funds towards districts with economically disadvantaged students. And the US Department of Education has a program called Title III that provides additional funding to districts with high numbers of English language learners. Both of these funding sources may not be used to supplant the services that districts provide to migrant students, but rather to supplement them. It is clear in the data that districts often choose to allocate this funding toward hiring more personnel to support migrant students or economically disadvantaged students. 
</p>

<p>
    In general, these plots serve as a good starting point for the rest of the project. Some natural questions that arise include: what exactly drives the differences between migrant and non-migrant districts?

            State Takeover Dataset
        </p>
        <p>
            In searching for a comprehensive dataset of state takeovers of local school districts, it was not immediately clear what constituted a “takeover”. State takeovers have been permitted by Congress since the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2001. States may take over a school district if that district fails to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). However, it is up to states to act on this right to take over a district, and every state has different criteria for what constitutes Adequate Yearly Progress. It is generally agreed that districts taken over are underperforming on standardized tests, but many states do not choose to intervene with their low performing districts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the ambiguity around takeovers, the definition used for takeover in this project will be that of Schueler and Bleiberg 2021: we define takeover as an instance when the state assumes control of an entire district and responds by either replacing all or part of the locally elected school board or superintendent with another decision maker or decision-making body. We exclusively track districtwide takeovers, not takeovers of individual schools. The dataset for all school districts taken over by their states between 2011 and 2016 is listed below. This dataset will be the experimental group for the project and all similar school districts otherwise not taken over will be the control group.

            National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data
        </p>
        <p>
            The National Center for Education Statistics hosts a repository of enrollment data and finance data on every school in the United States. The API uses a REST framework and can be queried through any language. I used R, and the documentation is hosted here. I pulled all available data for school districts in the United States from 2009-2020 into a csv. This data is further subdivided by race and sex. The purpose of this dataset is to see whether there is a significant difference in enrollment data between school districts that were taken over and otherwise similar school districts in the years before, during, and after the takeover.

            Civil Rights Data Collection
        </p>
        <p>
            The Civil Rights Data Collection is bi-annual survey given to schools that measures the following: Directory, Enrollment, Discipline, Harassment and bullying, Restraint and seclusion, Chronic absenteeism, Advanced coursework, and AP exams
SAT and ACT participation.

            The API uses a REST framework and can be queried through any language. I used R, and the documentation is hosted here: https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/#r. I pulled all available data for school districts in the United States from 2009-2020 into a csv. The purpose of this dataset is to see whether there is a significant difference in other school-level variables between school districts that were taken over and otherwise similar school districts.

            News API
        </p>
        <p>
            To better understand the overall discourse around K-12 education in the United States, News API was used. News API pulls the most popular headlines matching any keyword(s). The API works in any language, but Python was used for this query. For this project, the keyword was K-12 education based in the United States. The purpose of this dataset was to examine the overall discourse around K-12 education in the United States at this moment. This should provide insight into what the public is searching for and reading about the state of public education in the United States.

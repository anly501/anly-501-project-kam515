        <p>
            What can we learn from state takeovers of low-performing school districts?
        </p>
        <p>
            K-12 education in the United States is the subject of renewed interest after the disruptions from the covid pandemic. Nearly all public schools in the United States were virtual for at least part of the 2020-2021 school year. Data is just beginning to emerge about the impacts of the pandemic on student learning. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a standardized test given to students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grade with no stakes attached, gives an early indication of the impacts. In two years, the average reading score for a 4th grader fell by five points which represents the largest drop since 1990 (Bloomberg). Math scores dropped seven points–the first decline in the history of the test (Bloomberg). These results show that the pandemic erased 20 years of student gains in reading and math (Bloomberg). There is no question that education worsened because of the pandemic, but the question that follows is…what now? How do we respond to this discouraging data?

        <p>
            For this project, the state of education before the pandemic will be examined. We don’t know what the future holds for education, but the past can give us insight into what interventions have worked. Doing the best we can to serve students in response to the pandemic is not only the right thing to do, but it is critical for the future of our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
            State takeovers of low performing school districts can provide insight into what interventions work to improve student learning. School improvement is a widely-debated issue, but the best indicator we have is student test scores. 
        </p>
        <p>
            State takeovers have been permitted by Congress since the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2001. States may take over a school district if that district fails to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). There is no consistent definition of Adequate Yearly Progress, and state-to-state differences in enforcing AYP can be stark. 

        </p>
        <p>
            However, many states have chosen to take over entire school districts for a year. When this happens, the school board and superintendent are dismissed, and state officials manage all schools in the district. This drastic change in school leadership for one year can provide a natural experiment to study the impacts of changes made to the school system on student growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this exploratory data analysis, the following questions will be investigated:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. What approaches to management distinguish successful state takeovers?
        </p>
        <p>
            2. How is student engagement (truancy, advanced course participation, standardized test participation, etc.) affected by a state takeover? 
        </p>
            3. What does the general public have to say about K-12 education in the United States?
        <p>
        </p>
            4. How are student test scores impacted by a state takeover?
        <p>
        </p>
            5. How is control of a school system successfully returned to the local school system?
        <p>    
        </p>
            6. How are students of particular subgroups (e.g. race, gender, socioeconomic status, disability status, etc.) impacted by different interventions?
        <p> 
        </p>
            7. What happens to school finances before, during, and after successful state takeovers?
        <p>
        </p>
            8. What changes to school staffing are associated with successful state takeovers?
        <p>  
        </p>
            9. What can we learn from state takeovers to respond to the covid pandemic?
        <p>    
            10. What trends in student enrollment are associated with a state takeover?
        </p>
        <p>
            If state takeovers are successful, then we can learn from them to improve education in the United States. If state takeovers are not successful, then we can learn from them to avoid making the same mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some drawbacks of this study are that there was a major disruption to business as usual in our nation's schools--covid. However, this information should paint a picture of what happened before the pandemic from both the perspective of student record data and from the perspective of the general discourse around K-12 education. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What this study will also miss is that, even if a takeover has positive impacts on student test scores, staff retention, enrollment, and all of the other ESSA-measured data points, this analysis does not capture the monetary cost of a state takeover. The cost of a state takeover is not insignificant.

            Rutgers University produced a <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/appendix-B%3A-50-state-report/download">report</a> that, among other discussions, outlines the pros and cons of state takeovers of low-performing school districts:

           <tr>
              <!--ROW-1 COL-1-->
              <td>
                    <p>
                        PROS
                        Pros of State takeovers:
1. Are a necessary extension of a state’s constitutional responsibilities
2. Provide a good opportunity for state and local decision-makers to combine
resources and knowledge to improve children’s learning
3. Allow a competent executive staff to guide an uninterrupted and effective
implementation of school improvement efforts
4. Are a catalyst for creating the right environment for the community to address
a school district’s problems
5. Allow for more radical, and necessary, changes in low-performing school
districts
6. Place school boards on notice that personal agendas, nepotism and public
bickering have severe consequences
7. Use achievement data collected from school districts and schools to bolster
accountability efforts.

                <p>
                    Cons of State Takeovers:
1. Represent a thinly veiled attempt to reduce local control over schools and
increase state authority over school districts
2. Imply that the community has the problems and the state has the answers, and
thus falsely assume that states have the ability to effectively run school
districts
3. Place poorly prepared state-selected officials in charge, with little possibility
of any meaningful change occurring in the classroom
4. Use narrow learning measures (i.e., standardized test scores) as the primary
criterion for takeover decisions
5. Usually focus on cleaning up petty corruption and incompetent administration
and do not go to the root of the social problems facing disadvantaged students
in urban school districts
6. Foster negative connotations and impressions that hinder the self-esteem of
school board members, administrators, teachers, students and parents
7. Produce showdowns between state and local officials that slow the overhaul
of management practices, drain resources from educational reforms and
reinforce community resentments.

        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        
        <p>
            What can we learn from state takeovers of low-performing school districts?
        </p>
        <p>
            K-12 education in the United States is the subject of renewed interest after the disruptions from the covid pandemic. Nearly all public schools in the United States were virtual for at least part of the 2020-2021 school year. Data is just beginning to emerge about the impacts of the pandemic on student learning. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a standardized test given to students in 4th, 8th, and 12th grade with no stakes attached, gives an early indication of the impacts. In two years, the average reading score for a 4th grader fell by five points which represents the largest drop since 1990 (Bloomberg). Math scores dropped seven points–the first decline in the history of the test (Bloomberg). These results show that the pandemic erased 20 years of student gains in reading and math (Bloomberg). There is no question that education worsened because of the pandemic, but the question that follows is…what now? How do we respond to this discouraging data?

            For this project, the state of education before the pandemic will be examined. We don’t know what the future holds for education, but the past can give us insight into what interventions have worked. Doing the best we can to serve students in response to the pandemic is not only the right thing to do, but it is critical for the future of our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
            State takeovers of low performing school districts can provide insight into what interventions work to improve student learning. School improvement is a widely-debated issue, but the best indicator we have is student test scores. 
        </p>
        <p>
            State takeovers have been permitted by Congress since the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2001. States may take over a school district if that district fails to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). There is no consistent definition of Adequate Yearly Progress, and state-to-state differences in enforcing AYP can be stark. 

        </p>
        <p>
            However, many states have chosen to take over entire school districts for a year. When this happens, the school board and superintendent are dismissed, and state officials manage all schools in the district. This drastic change in school leadership for one year can provide a natural experiment to study the impacts of changes made to the school system on student growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this exploratory data analysis, the following questions will be investigated:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. What approaches to management distinguish successful state takeovers?
        </p>
        <p>
            2. How is student engagement (truancy, advanced course participation, standardized test participation, etc.) affected by a state takeover? 
        </p>
            3. What does the general public have to say about K-12 education in the United States?
        <p>
        </p>
            4. How are student test scores impacted by a state takeover?
        <p>
        </p>
            5. How is control of a school system successfully returned to the local school system?
        <p>    
        </p>
            6. How are students of particular subgroups (e.g. race, gender, socioeconomic status, disability status, etc.) impacted by different interventions?
        <p> 
        </p>
            7. What happens to school finances before, during, and after successful state takeovers?
        <p>
        </p>
            8. What changes to school staffing are associated with successful state takeovers?
        <p>  
        </p>
            9. What can we learn from state takeovers to respond to the covid pandemic?
        <p>    
            10. What trends in student enrollment are associated with a state takeover?
